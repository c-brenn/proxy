# Proxy

A simple HTTP proxy in Elixir, written for a college assignment.

At the time of writing, it does not conform to RFC standard yet and only
supports HTTP requests.

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- run `mix deps.get`

## Running It

Use `mix serve` to start the proxy server on port 8080.
