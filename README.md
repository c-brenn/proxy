# Proxy

A simple HTTP proxy in Elixir, written for a college assignment, that can handle
HTTP and HTTPS.

It performs basic caching and urls can be blocked.

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- run `mix deps.get`

## Running It

Use `mix phoenix.server` to start the proxy server on port 8080, and the admin
console on port 4000.
